Nobody likes to be alone always, but sometimes loneliness could be a better medicine to hunch the thirst for a peaceful environment. Even during such lonely quarantines, we may ignore humans but not humanoids. Yes, if you have guessed this article for a chatbot, then you have cracked it right. We won’t require 6000 lines of code to create a chatbot but just a six-letter word “Python” is enough. Let us have a quick glance at Python’s ChatterBot to create our bot. ChatterBot is a Python library built based on machine learning with an inbuilt conversational dialog flow and training engine. The bot created using this library will get trained automatically with the response it gets from the user.
